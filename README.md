<h2> thewatchseries.to link scraper </h2>

<h3> Intro </h3>
This is my first program I have written in go lang. It is a simple link extractor for a popular streaming service. <br />
It should automatically detect if the link is a complete series link, a single season or just an episode.

<h3> Required Packages </h3>

gopkg.in/cheggaaa/pb.v1<br />
github.com/jackdanger/collectlinks

<h3> Usage </h3>

go run crawl.go http://thewatchseries.to/link/here output_file.txt

<h3> Feedback </h3>

Any feedback on how I could improve this program or my crappy programming please let me know :)
